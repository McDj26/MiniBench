To complete the test case, you need to provide actual values for the placeholders in the comments (e.g., "Expected codeword value" and "A symbol value that doesn't exist"). These values will depend on the implementation details of the `PDF417Common` class and its `SYMBOL_TABLE` and `CODEWORD_TABLE` arrays which are not provided in the context. You would typically obtain these values by inspecting the actual implementation or documentation of the class or by trial and error through actual testing.
