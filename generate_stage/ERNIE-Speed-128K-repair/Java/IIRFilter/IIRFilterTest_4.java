In this test case, you need to fill in the following placeholders:

1. Set the desired order for the filter (`order`) based on your requirements. This should be an integer value representing the order of the IIR filter.
2. Initialize `coeffsA` and `coeffsB` arrays with actual coefficients for the filter. These are typically determined by the specific design of your filter and should be filled based on your requirements or test cases.
3. Provide an actual sample value (`sample`) to process in the `processTest` method. This should be a double value representing a sample input to the filter.
4. Calculate the expected result (`expectedResult`) based on the sample value and coefficients you provide. This could be done externally to verify the logic of your IIRFilter implementation.
5. Set a tolerance value to account for discrepancies in floating point arithmetic when comparing the expected result with the actual result obtained from `iirFilter.process(sample)`. This value should be small enough to detect meaningful differences but large enough to accommodate minor discrepancies due to floating point arithmetic.
