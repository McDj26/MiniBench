    public void processTest() {
        double sample = 1.0; // Test sample value
        double expectedResult = /* Expected result based on the filter's coefficients and sample */; // This should be calculated externally to the test for a known output (e.g., from a known input signal and coefficients)
        double actualResult = iirFilter.process(sample); // Process the sample using the IIRFilter
        assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult, "The processed sample did not match the expected result."); // Assert that the actual result matches the expected result with a specific tolerance value if necessary
    }
}

Note: The COEFFS_A and COEFFS_B arrays need to be populated with actual coefficients for the test to be meaningful. The expectedResult should be calculated based on known input signal and coefficients (either manually or through simulation). If the exact calculation is complex or not feasible, you can use mock values or results from previous experiments to validate the process method's behavior.
