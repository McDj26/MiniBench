public class IIRFilterTest {
    private IIRFilter iirFilter;
    private double[] coeffsA = { /* coefficients for A */ }; // Replace with actual coefficients
    private double[] coeffsB = { /* coefficients for B */ }; // Replace with actual coefficients
    private static final int FILTER_ORDER = /* Filter order */; // Replace with actual order value

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        iirFilter = new IIRFilter(FILTER_ORDER);
        iirFilter.setCoeffs(coeffsA, coeffsB); // Assuming setCoeffs is properly implemented
    }

    @Test
    public void processTest() {
        double sampleInput = /* Sample input value */; // Replace with actual sample value
        double expectedOutput = /* Expected output value */; // Replace with expected output based on the filter logic

}

In the above test case, you need to replace the following placeholders with actual values:

1. /* coefficients for A */ - These are the coefficients for the "A" part of the filter which you need to provide based on the IIR filter design specifications.
2. /* coefficients for B */ - These are the coefficients for the "B" part of the filter which you need to provide based on the IIR filter design specifications.
3. /* Filter order */ - This represents the order of the IIR filter which should be an integer value specific to your design.
4. /* Sample input value */ - This is a sample input value that you would pass to the process method to test its functionality. You can provide any valid double value as an input sample.
5. /* Expected output value */ - This is the expected output of the process method based on the filter's design and the given input sample. This should be calculated based on the filter's behavior and used as a reference for comparison in the assertion.

Note: Make sure to initialize your iirFilter instance with a valid order before performing any tests on it. Additionally, make sure to replace the provided coefficient placeholders with actual coefficients specific to your IIR filter design.
