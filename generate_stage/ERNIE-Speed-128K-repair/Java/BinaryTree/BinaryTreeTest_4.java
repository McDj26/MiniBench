In this test case, we first create an empty BinaryTree instance and then insert nodes with values 4, 3, and 5 to get references to these nodes. Then we remove each node by both using its value and directly using its reference to assert the correctness of the `remove` method in various scenarios where nodes are removed as root nodes or inner nodes with or without children. Finally, we assert that removing a non-existent value or a non-existing node returns `false`.
