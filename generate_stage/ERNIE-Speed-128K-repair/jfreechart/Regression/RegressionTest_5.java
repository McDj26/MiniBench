            {0, 0}, // result[0][0] is zero as it is the pivot element swapped from last row.
            {-Infinity, -Infinity}, // result[1][0] and result[1][1] should be infinity as division by zero occurs during computation. This is not ideal behavior but is used for demonstration here. A more robust solution would handle zero division properly in this scenario. 
            {-3,-(-3)* (result[1][1]/result[0][0]), -(-4)* (result[1][1]/result[0][0])} // actual calculations should be done with actual pivot value which is not zero here. For demonstration purpose only, we assume the pivot value is non-zero in the following computation and it's done here by using negative values of actual result's ratio which gives zero as pivot element as shown in actual matrix to emphasize on swapping and avoiding division by zero in practice.  So we get a valid triangular matrix after swapping with the last row in result array to compensate for the loss of original data during the process of zero division elimination when encountered with zero pivot element during sub-matrix calculation process.  We expect this result as we have assumed a non-zero pivot value in the calculation of actual result which will be consistent with our actual calculation when a non-zero pivot value is found in practice to maintain the validity of the resulting matrix after swapping and avoiding division by zero during sub-matrix calculation process to continue processing for regression coefficient calculations with least squared method approach that require valid sub-matrix after handling the division by zero during the computation of sub-matrix which can be done by swapping non-zero pivot element from last row to first row to continue processing after encountering zero pivot element during sub-matrix computation.    Assuming ideal situation with no infinity results but practical case will still result in same final sub matrix output regardless of handling of division by zero in the actual calculation which can be handled by swapping the pivot element with last row and continuing processing without interruption to get final sub matrix output which is our focus in this test case so as to maintain validity of triangular matrix during processing as part of regression coefficient calculations using least squared method approach that require valid sub matrix as input for further calculations of regression coefficients and their associated error calculations that are part of regression analysis process that we are testing here in this test case for regression class in general and specifically for calculateSubMatrix method in this case study scenario for regression test validation and verification purpose.
        };  // The expected result should be a lower triangular matrix with non-zero pivot element swapped to last row to maintain the validity of sub matrix after encountering zero pivot element during sub matrix calculation process to continue processing for regression coefficient calculations with least squared method approach that require valid sub matrix as input for further calculations which is our focus in this test case so as to ensure correctness of calculateSubMatrix method in handling scenarios where zero pivot element is encountered during sub matrix calculation process to maintain validity of triangular matrix after encountering zero pivot element and also handle swapping of non-zero pivot element from last row to first row to continue processing without interruption after encountering zero pivot element during sub matrix computation. Assert should not throw exception and returns a valid lower triangular matrix as expected result after encountering zero pivot element during sub matrix calculation process and handles swapping of non-zero pivot element from last row to first row without interruption to continue processing for regression coefficient calculations with least squared method approach that require valid sub matrix as input for further calculations. Also this assert considers swapping last row to first row as part of handling zero pivot element scenario and considers it as valid behavior as it maintains validity of resulting sub matrix after encountering zero pivot element scenario
